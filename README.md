# AppleStockTSAnalysis
This repository contains a comprehensive time series analysis of Apple Inc. stock from 1980 to 2024. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, modeling, and forecasting using various statistical and time series machine learning techniques.

For the first part, and after performing data cleansing, we conducted a preliminary analysis to identify any underlying seasonality, trends, and 
patterns within the data, without the application of a specific model. As well as providing some visualizations to explore shapes of data.

For the second part, we used at least two time series methods for modeling and forecasting, we generated some future forecasts and compared between the models.

In the third part, , we introduced an explanatory variable, exogenous to the dataset, which is related to the dataset 
subject. Then we incorporated this variable into the analysis to demonstrate its impact on the primary dataset. We used visualization and modeling to explain the effect.

The code for the above parts is in the notebook provided in main.

We also summarized the results in a seperated Word file for your consideration.
